# Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense â€“ IMU and Temperature Sensor

This project demonstrates how to interface with onboard sensors on the **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2**, specifically the **BMI270_BMM150 IMU** and the **HS300x temperature and humidity sensor**. The goal is to read real-time environmental and motion data using C++ and the Arduino IDE.
